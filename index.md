The answers to the following four prompts, which are meant to help you brainstorm for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, due on December 2nd. For each prompt, state the question that you’re answering in bold and write your answer immediately underneath on a new line. Make sure you’ve familarized yourself with the Quarter 2 Project Proposal specifications before proceeding!

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
<br>
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the application of differentially private mechanisms in various companies and industries. It’s fascinating to explore how these methods are implemented and whether they make sense in real-world scenarios.
<br>
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
<br>
I would like to investigate different differentially private mechanisms for a multitude of analysis from the intel telemetry dataset. 
<br>
<br>
**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
<br>
One change I'd like to make to the approach taken in the current Quarter 1 Project is test different types of logistic regression models. Right now we have only experimented with SGD but should try other models like Objective-Perturbation and FTRL.
<br>
<br>
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
<br>
A different technique I would be interested in using in the project is possibly a different way to visualize performance. Right now we are using matplotlib for most of the graphs but can experiment with different libraries like Seaborn or Plotly
